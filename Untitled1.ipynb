        "Recommendation systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users. For a platform like Netflix, which has a vast library of movies and TV shows and millions of users, effective recommendation systems are crucial for improving user engagement and satisfaction. Two primary types of recommendation systems are:\n",

        "1.  **Content-Based Recommendation Systems:**\n",
        "    These systems recommend items based on the characteristics of the items themselves and a user's past preferences. They analyze features of items that a user has liked or interacted with and then recommend similar items. For example, if a user watches and enjoys several action movies starring a specific actor, a content-based system might recommend other action movies featuring the same actor or similar themes. For Netflix, this means analyzing metadata like genre, cast, director, plot keywords, and even visual elements of movies and shows to find similar content to what a user has previously enjoyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems:**\n",
        "    Collaborative filtering works by leveraging the interactions between users and items. It assumes that if two users have similar tastes or behaviors (e.g., they both liked or watched the same items), they are likely to have similar preferences for other items as well. There are two main types: user-based collaborative filtering (finding users similar to the current user and recommending items they liked) and item-based collaborative filtering (finding items similar to those the current user liked based on how other users rated or interacted with them). For Netflix, collaborative filtering is highly relevant because it can identify patterns in viewing behavior across its large user base. For instance, if many users who watched a particular sci-fi series also watched a specific fantasy movie, the system might recommend that fantasy movie to a user who just finished the sci-fi series, even if the content features are not directly similar.\n",

Since a dedicated C++ CSV library is not confirmed to be available, I will refine the parsing logic to account for potentially quoted fields and re-examine the column indices based on the CSV structure.

The output shows 1000 movies loaded, which is the expected number of rows in the dataset, and the first movie's title is correct, but the rating (2.34311e+06) looks incorrect, likely mixing No_of_Votes and Gross with the rating. I need to re-examine the C++ code and the header to correct the column index for the rating. The header shows 'IMDB_Rating' is at index 6 and 'No_of_Votes' is at index 14.

A common technique is using a vector space model where each unique genre, director, or actor in the entire dataset becomes a dimension in a high-dimensional space. A movie's presence (or absence) of a particular feature is marked in its corresponding dimension.\n",

This index will correspond to a dimension in our feature vectors. This is built by iterating through all movies and collecting all unique genres, directors, and actors.\n",
        "*   **`std::vector<float> feature_vector;`**: For each movie, we will create a vector of floats. The size of this vector will be equal to the total number of unique features found in `feature_index_map`.

For each genre present in a movie, we find its index in `feature_index_map` and set the corresponding element in the movie's `feature_vector` to 1.\n",
        "*   **Director:** The `director` string contains the director's name. We find the director's index in `feature_index_map` and set the corresponding element in the movie's `feature_vector` to 1.\n",
        "*   **Actors:** The `actors` string contains concatenated actor names (e.g., \"Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler\"). We will split this string by \", \" to get individual actor names. For each actor, we find their index in `feature_index_map` and set the corresponding element in the movie's `feature_vector` to 1.\n",

This typically involves converting categorical text data into vectors.\n\n**1. Transformation for Content-Based Filtering:**\n\nThe `Movie` struct currently holds features as strings: `genre`, `director`, and `actors`. For content-based filtering, we need to represent these as numerical vectors. A common technique is using a vector space model where each unique genre, director, or actor in the entire dataset becomes a dimension in a high-dimensional space. A movie's presence (or absence) of a particular feature is marked in its corresponding dimension.\n\n**2. C++ Data Structures for Feature Representation:**\n\nWe will use the following C++ data structures:\n\n*   **`std::unordered_map<std::string, int> feature_index_map;`**: This map will store a mapping from each unique feature string (e.g., \"Action\", \"Quentin Tarantino\", \"Tim Robbins\") to a unique integer index. This index will correspond to a dimension in our feature vectors. This is built by iterating through all movies and collecting all unique genres, directors, and actors.\n*   **`std::vector<float> feature_vector;`**: For each movie, we will create a vector of floats. The size of this vector will be equal to the total number of unique features found in `feature_index_map`. The value at each index `i` in the vector will represent the presence or weight of the feature corresponding to index `i` in `feature_index_map` for that specific movie.\n\nFor our categorical features (genre, director, actors), a **multi-hot encoding** is suitable:\n\n*   **Genre:** The `genre` string in the `Movie` struct is typically a comma-separated list (e.g., \"Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi\"). We will split this string into individual genres. For each genre present in a movie, we find its index in `feature_index_map` and set the corresponding element in the movie's `feature_vector` to 1.\n*   **Director:** The `director` string contains the director's name. We find the director's index in `feature_index_map` and set the corresponding element in the movie's `feature_vector` to 1.\n*   **Actors:** The `actors` string contains concatenated actor names (e.g., \"Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler\"). We will split this string by \", \" to get individual actor names. For each actor, we find their index in `feature_index_map` and set the corresponding element in the movie's `feature_vector` to 1.\n\nThe `rating` could also be incorporated, but for a basic content-based approach focused on movie characteristics, genre, director, and actors are the primary features.\n\n**Example Feature Vector Construction (Conceptual):**\n\nLet's say `feature_index_map` has indices for \"Action\": 0, \"Comedy\": 1, \"Quentin Tarantino\": 2, \"Brad Pitt\": 3.\n\nA movie with Genre: \"Action,Comedy\", Director: \"Quentin Tarantino\", Actors: \"Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio\" would have a feature vector like: `[1, 1, 1, 1, ...]` where the 1s are at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3, and other dimensions are 0 (assuming \"Leonardo DiCaprio\" and other features have indices beyond 3).\n\n**3. Storage of Movie Representations:**\n\nThe collection of all movie feature vectors will be stored in a `std::vector` of `std::vector<float>`:\n\n*   **`std::vector<std::vector<float>> movie_feature_vectors;`**: This will be a vector where each element is the feature vector for a corresponding movie in the `movies` vector loaded previously. The order should be consistent between `movies` and `movie_feature_vectors` so that `movies[i]` corresponds to `movie_feature_vectors[i]`.वरुनThis structure allows for efficient access to any movie's feature vector by its index. Similarity comparisons (like cosine similarity) can then be performed between these vectors.\n\nTo efficiently find movies similar to a given movie, after calculating similarity scores between the target movie's vector and all other movie vectors, we would store these scores, perhaps in a `std::vector` of pairs (`<float, int>`) where the float is the similarity score and the int is the index of the movie. This vector can then be sorted in descending order of similarity.\n"

This is likely caused by using `%%writefile` with a multi-line C++ code block that contains comments or strings that confuse the Python interpreter. The fix is to ensure the C++ code is correctly formatted within the `%%writefile` block.
